Enemies and towers usually have varied abilities, costs, and ability costs. When an enemy is defeated, the player earns money or points, which are used to buy or upgrade towers, or upgrade the number of money or points that are earned, or even upgrade the rate at which they upgrade.\r\n[Tower Defense on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense)\r\n\r\n### Thanks to FlashGameTuts\r\nThis game was adapted from this basic [original Source](http://www.flashgametuts.com/tutorials/advanced/how-to-create-a-tower-defense-game-in-as3-part-1/)\r\n\r\n### Tags\r\ntowerdefense, tower, defense, actionscript, as, as3, flash, game, world of war craft, wow, classic","google":"UA-3919975-2"}
